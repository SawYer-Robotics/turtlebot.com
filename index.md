# What is a TurtleBot?
TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. TurtleBot was created at Willow Garage by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in November 2010. With TurtleBot, youâ€™ll be able to build a robot that can drive around your house, see in 3D, and have enough horsepower to create exciting applications.

For more information, we recommend an interview with TurtleBot creators, Tully Foote and Melonee Wise.
